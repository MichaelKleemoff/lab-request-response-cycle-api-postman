# Request Response Cycle, APIs, and Postman Lab

You will be working with a free API of your choice for this lab.

## Getting Started

1. Choose an API that has no auth and no CORS from the following list: [public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)
1. Write your answers in this README.md file. Do not delete the questions. Write your answers after the `>`. If you need to write more than one paragraph, add more `>`.

## Instructions

Do your best to answer the questions with specific details when required fully. Writing about code clearly and thoroughly is a critical skill to practice.

- Which one did you choose? Provide the name and base URL

> https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/routes
> Google Maps Routes API

- What purpose is this API for (education/fun and games/information/etc.)?

> The purpose of this API is to geocode which means, 'to provide geographical coordinates corresponding to (a location).' - (cite: https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+geocoding&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS980US980&oq=what+is+geocoding&aqs=chrome..69i57j0i512l9.4657j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)

- What is the URL of the documentation?

> http://

- What is the full URL of one endpoint?

> http://

- What is a sample of the data from the endpoint (copy and paste results from Postman, ok to shorten if itâ€™s over 100 lines)? Be sure to wrap your answer in the correct formatting for code/JSON.

```json


```

- What status code did you get back?

> 00

- Click on the **response** headers in Postman. What are the `Content-Type` and `Content-Length` (provide exact values)?

> `Content-Type`

> `Content-Length`
